# Steps to run the project:

1. Train the model with the `trainin/training_yolo_v5.ipynb` notebook
    - You will need a Roboflow API key (which you can create for free).
    - Link to Roboflow dataset: [Football Players Detection Dataset](https://universe.roboflow.com/roboflow-jvuqo/football-players-detection-3zvbc/dataset/1)

2. Run the `main.py`
    - It will use the best weights for the trained model.
